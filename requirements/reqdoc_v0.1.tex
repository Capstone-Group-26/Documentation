\section{Introduction}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
Currently, when a baby is taken to the doctor for routine checkups, part of the checkup process is measuring the child's height and width, as well as several other measurements. This project is to create an iOS application that obtains the photo of the baby and calculates head circumference and overall body length. The measurements are then related to the standard WHO growth charts to give a parent a comparison of their baby's growth.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Purpose}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent

\par Although it may seem unintuitive, building an application that finds simple baby measurement metrics may improve several other healthcare factors, including cost, early disease screening, and health service accessibility.\\

\textbf{Cost}
\par It is often difficult for worried parents to tell whether their baby is developing healthily and normally. This can lead to extra hospital visits which increases healthcare costs for all healthcare consumers. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends babies get checkups at birth, 3 to 5 days after birth, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 24 months\cite{checkup}. Cost of these checkups average around 100 dollars per visit\cite{cost}, while the average number of new births each year in the US is around 3.8 million\cite{births}. If only 1 percent of children can be prevented from making an extra visit to the doctor's, this would conservatively save 3.8 million dollars from the healthcare system.\\

\textbf{Early Disease Screening}\\
\par This screening would allow parents to check if their baby is far outside the average range in height or width for their age. In rare cases, this can indicate the following:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Congenital hypothyroidism: 1 in 2,500 to 3,000 babies each year are born with this, translating to 1266 babies every year in the US.\\
\item Congenital Growth hormone deficiency: 1 in 7,000 babies each year are born with this, translating to 542 babies every year in the US. \\
\end{itemize}

\par Earlier feedback from these diagnoses can lead to better health outcomes for infants, who would otherwise be diagnosed later and need more intensive treatment or have worse lifetime health as a result. If congenital hypothyroidism is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as mental disability, growth delays, or loss of hearing. If congenital Growth hormone deficiency is untreated, it may result in slower muscular development, reduced energy, impaired concentration and memory loss, greatly reduced height, and reduced bone mass and osteoporosis\\

\textbf{Access}\\
In rural areas or countries where immediate access to doctors and hospitals is uncommon, this application may benefit parents who would not otherwise have easy access to the checkups that pediatricians provide, allowing them access to medical services that they might not otherwise have.

\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Scope}

\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The application shall be used from the perspective of a household. Parents/guardians will be using it for independent use, whether that entails growth concern or fun surrounding their baby. User feedback has directed us to the idea that keeping track of a baby's growth is an interesting and fun activity, outside of the immediate health concerns to their child. The application will have the capability to inform concerned parents about the growth of their baby if they seek the medical meaning of growth.\\ \par

The scope of this application will not be delving into medical professional use. No regulations in accordance to HIPAA or other medical regulations will be accomplished.

%\subsection{Overview}
%\begin{singlespace}

%\end{singlespace}

\section{Overall Description}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The following sections will outline a high-level description of the product. Specifics regarding the product perspective, functions, user characteristics, constraints, assumptions and dependencies, and apportioning of requirements will be covered.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Product Perspective}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
    The application is for a parent who would like to track their baby's growth and compare it against standard WHO growth charts. Specifically, the parent would be interested in seeing a report, such as a  table or chart, of their baby's growth over time; additionally, they would like to see both the current measurements and growth rate compared against standards to see if their baby was growing healthily.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Product Functions}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
For ease of use, we think the user would appreciate a simple, snappy interface. On the surface, the UI mimics a smart capture application, such as a mobile check or document scanner. The user simply points the camera at a baby; once the iOS device gathers sufficient data for measurement, the UI will snap to the "results" screen. The user can choose whether the results are displayed as a table or chart. Furthermore, they can ask for a comparison to standard growth charts.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{User Characteristics}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The user will be using this application for one of two purposes: family fun or medical concern/reassurance. The product to some parents/guardians will be purely used because they find joy in finding out how much the baby is growing. Another use is by concerned parents/guardians who think their baby is growing too little or too much. They want information based on the growth of the baby and that's what this application will do. Growing an inch could be a heartwarming moment or it could put a restless mind to ease, which are the feelings the user will have when using this product.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Constraints}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
Our application is not meant to be a replacement for scientific instruments. In other words, it's not recommended for pediatric use. It's a handy tool for a parent who would like a "good enough" estimate of their baby's head circumference and height.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
According to Apple, "ARKit 3 features will only be supported on iPhones and iPads that are powered by an A12 Bionic processor or newer"\cite{arkit3support}. These include the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, and the 11-inch and 12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pros. We assume that a sizable portion of the consumer base own these devices.\\

Obviously, our application is dependent on the ARKit 3 framework, which provides methods for mapping points on the body and measuring distances.\\

SQLite or another database management system is being considered for storing measurement data locally on the iOS device.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Apportioning of Requirements}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
We currently do not have the depth of technical knowledge for the work ahead of us to apportion it. We certainly have done preliminary research into the ARKit framework, but we haven't developed a technical plan with concrete steps and components. We will be dividing up the components between our 3 members equally while all working cohesively. We will probably have more development effort dedicated to ARKit and computer vision vs general UI.
\end{singlespace}

\section{Specific Requirements}
\begin{singlespace}
The specific requirements for this application will include the front-end and back-end interfaces for the application. The functionality, performance, usability, compatibility and compliance will have specific features that will be detailed with performance measures that we plan to obtain.
\end{singlespace}
\subsection{Interfaces}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The two separate interfaces: user and software, depict the same application. The user interface is from the front-side, what the users can see and control. The software side is how the application components interact behind the scenes.
\end{singlespace}

\subsubsection{User Interfaces}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The concept behind the user interface is to keep it as clean and simple as possible. Users shall begin by opening the app into a screen that follows the camera. A popup will open upon initialization due to accessing their camera being needed. The user will be prompted/told to hold the camera to get a view of the entirety of the baby from the front. The user would then be prompted/told to move the camera to get a view from the top of the baby's head. Once the application has had both necessary views, the user will be met with a new screen holding the measurements that were calculated: body height and head circumference. The user will also have an button/option to get further information that compares the measurements of their baby to a medically healthy, average baby.\\
\end{singlespace}

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The software will have three main components: application base, ARkit and the database. The application base will be the code needed to launch the app through an iOS device along with the code the controls user interaction. The ARkit is a framework that will be incorporated to track the visual representative while obtaining the required measurements. Our database will be to hold the values that the ARkit gathers, so that the application base can then take the values and pull medical information to the user from an online source.\\ \par

The three main components interact cohesively and simultaneously. The application base will be interacting with the users, who are using the ARkit, which in turn uses the database. The database receives measurements from the ARkit and the database sends those measurements to the application base to decide what to send the user.
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The functional requirements detail the features and functions that the end product must be able to perform.\\

\textbf{ID: FR-0}\\
TITLE: Measure baby height\\
DESC: Need to research various different paths to implement baby height measurement, keeping in mind multiple joints and measurement points that need to be taken into account\\
RAT: Core requirement of being able to measure baby growth and natural progress\\
DEPEND: May make use of the ARBodyTrackingConfiguration class in ARKit to automatically track body height\\

\textbf{ID: FR-1}\\
TITLE: Measure baby head width\\
DESC: Use basic point to point measurement to measure baby head width starting from the ARKit body tracking head centerpoint\\
RAT: Secondary tracking metric for baby growth, screening for congenital microcephaly\\
DEPEND: May make use of ARFaceAnchor class in ARKit to find head centerpoint\\

\textbf{ID: FR-2}\\
TITLE: Store baby measurements\\
DESC: Store all baby measurements in local database under child entities such that each parent can have multiple children which have a timeseries array of height and head width measurements. May use SQLite or some noSQL equivalent. May do an online DB for user backups depending on extra time\\
RAT: Users should be able to compare their baby measurements against previous measurements to track growth\\
DEPEND: SQLite or similar\\

\textbf{ID: FR-3}\\
TITLE: Baby growth charts\\
DESC: The application should have charts that allow the user to see the baby's growth over time, and to see the baby's growth over time overlaid with growth percentiles for a healthy child of the baby's age\\
RAT: Users should be able to check growth in a friendly and intuitive way that allows them to quickly grasp information\\
DEPEND: Some swift charting library, maybe AAChartKit-Swift\\

\textbf{ID: FR-4}\\
TITLE: Baby Choosing Menu\\
DESC: The user should be able to choose between multiple different children to measure. Each child should have a different series of measurement records associated with it\\
RAT: Parents should be able to measure each of their children and store the results separately if they have multiple children\\
DEPEND: None\\
\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Performance and Usability Requirements}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The performance and usability requirements concern the execution speed, setup, and tutorial  to which the end product must conform.\\

\textbf{ID: PR-0}\\
TITLE: Measurements taken with $>$90\% accuracy\\
DESC: In order to build a useful application that users trust, the application must $>$90\% accurate in the measurements it gathers. If measurements are more than 10\% off, growth charts may be distorted by errors and the system might incorrectly place the baby in an unhealthy growth percentile\\
RAT: Accuracy is a performance requirement that the application depends on\\
DEPEND: None\\

\textbf{ID: PR-1}\\
TITLE: Measurements taken in $<$10 seconds\\
DESC: The application should be easy to use, requiring few user interactions to get the measurements it needs.\\
RAT: If the user experience is overly onerous, users will default back to manual measurements using a tape measure or similar\\
DEPEND: None\\


\end{singlespace}

\subsection{Compatibility and Compliance Requirements}
\begin{singlespace}
\noindent
The compatibility and compliance requirements concern the software and systems to which the end product must be compatible.\\

\textbf{ID: CR-0}\\
TITLE: HIPPA Compliance\\
DESC: We need to make sure that our application does not violate HIPPA healthcare privacy laws\\
RAT: The penalties for HIPPA noncompliance are based on the level of negligence and can range from \$100 to \$50,000 per violation.\\
DEPEND: None\\
